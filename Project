MemGPT is a system that enables large language models (LLMs) to manage extended contexts by emulating operating system memory hierarchies. It divides memory into main context (active prompt tokens) and external context (persistent storage), allowing the LLM to dynamically read from and write to these storage tiers. This design facilitates the retrieval of pertinent historical data and the eviction of less relevant information, effectively providing the illusion of an infinite context window. By employing function calls to handle control flow and memory management, MemGPT allows LLMs to maintain continuity over long-term interactions and analyze documents that exceed their native context limitations. ￼

To generate user-specific responses, MemGPT can store personalized information in its external context. When a user engages with the system, the LLM can retrieve this stored data and incorporate it into the prompt, tailoring responses to the individual’s preferences and history. This approach ensures that interactions are contextually relevant and personalized, enhancing the user experience by leveraging the system’s managed memory to maintain and utilize user-specific information effectively.
