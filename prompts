4. Example Inclusion (1 additional point): The answer includes at least one relevant example to illustrate the point.
5. Source Citation (1 additional point): The answer provides a link or reference to a credible source.

After evaluating the answer, you should:

1. Assign a score from 1 to 5 based on how many of the above criteria are met.

```json
{
  "question": "The original question",
  "answer": "The provided answer",
  "score": 0,
  "explanation": "Your explanation of the score"
