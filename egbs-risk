ðŸ“ˆ Executive Summary: Yield-Based Risk & PnL Attribution Framework

â¸»

ðŸŸ¢ Overview

This framework is designed for precise measurement, decomposition, and attribution of risk and PnL in portfolios sensitive to interest rate changes. It covers 79 instruments, representing:
	â€¢	9 countries Ã— 8 tenors (72 instruments)
	â€¢	7 futures contracts

We transparently identify sources of portfolio performance, enabling insightful management decisions and effective hedging.

ðŸŸ¢ Top-Level Portfolio Risk & PnL

We first calculate total risk and daily PnL from observed historical changes:
	â€¢	Daily PnL:
\text{PnL}_t = \Delta R_t \cdot w

where:
	â€¢	\Delta R_t \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times79}: Daily yield changes
	â€¢	w \in \mathbb{R}^{79\times1}: Portfolio weights or sensitivities
	â€¢	Rolling Risk (variance-based):
\Sigma_t = \text{Cov}(\Delta R_{t-h:t}) \quad ; \quad \text{Risk}_t = w^\top \Sigma_t w

Historical validation ensures robust portfolio risk measures.

ðŸŸ¢ Aggregated Group-Level Analysis

For simpler risk attribution, the 79 instruments are aggregated into broader risk groups via expert definitions or data-driven clustering (e.g., UMAP):
	â€¢	Grouping Matrix G maps instruments into K risk groups:
G \in \mathbb{R}^{K\times79}
	â€¢	Ensuring comprehensive coverage:
\sum_{k} G_{k,i} = 1,\quad\forall i\in[1,79]
	â€¢	Grouped PnL calculation:

# Daily instrument-level PnL (time Ã— portfolio Ã— instrument)
PnL_contributions = np.einsum('ti,pi->tpi', Î”R, W)

# Aggregate into groups (time Ã— portfolio Ã— group)
grouped_pnl = np.einsum('tpi,ki->tpk', PnL_contributions, G)

This approach clearly highlights how broad market segments contribute to portfolio performance.

ðŸŸ¢ Flexible Portfolio and Hedge Management

The framework naturally supports multiple portfolios and regression-based hedging:
	â€¢	Portfolio and hedge positions combined into a unified matrix:
W{\prime} = \begin{bmatrix}W_{\text{portfolio}}\\ W_{\text{hedge}}\end{bmatrix}, \quad W{\prime} \in \mathbb{R}^{(P+H)\times79}
	â€¢	Hedging via Regression:
	â€¢	Optimal hedge weights are derived by regressing the portfolio returns onto selected hedging instruments:
W_{\text{hedge}} = -(\beta), \quad\text{with}\quad \beta = (\Delta R_{\text{hedge}}^\top \Delta R_{\text{hedge}})^{-1}\Delta R_{\text{hedge}}^\top \Delta R_{\text{portfolio}}
	â€¢	Evaluate hedge effectiveness instantly by measuring variance before and after hedging:

# Unhedged portfolio variance
Risk_unhedged = W_portfolio @ Î£_t @ W_portfolio.T

# Hedged portfolio variance
W_combined = W_portfolio + W_hedge
Risk_hedged = W_combined @ Î£_t @ W_combined.T

# Hedge Efficiency
Efficiency = (Risk_unhedged - Risk_hedged) / Risk_unhedged

This clearly quantifies hedge effectiveness and helps fine-tune hedging strategies rapidly.

ðŸŸ¢ Scenario Analysis (Country & Tenor-specific)

The framework includes powerful scenario analysis capabilities:
	â€¢	Scenarios can be applied flexibly to:
	â€¢	All groups
	â€¢	Selected subsets (specific tenors, countries, or products)

Example: stress 2-year tenors in Germany by +50bps instantly, showing immediate portfolio impact.

â¸»

ðŸŸ¢ Granular Decomposition

Risk and PnL can be further decomposed into specific underlying dimensions (country, tenor, product):
	â€¢	Using dimension-specific masks:

# Example: isolate tenor-specific contributions (2Y)
tenor_mask = np.array([1 if m['tenor']=='2Y' else 0 for m in metadata])

# Decompose Grouped PnL by tenor within a group
tenor_contributions = np.einsum('tpi,i->tp', PnL_contributions, tenor_mask * G[group_idx])

This granular visibility simplifies identifying exactly where risk and returns originate.

ðŸŸ¢ Historical Validation & Continuous Improvement
	â€¢	Historical Validation:
	â€¢	Backtesting ensures reliability:
\text{HistoricalRisk}_t = w^\top \Sigma_t w
	â€¢	Real-time tracking enables forward-looking scenario analyses to quickly adapt to changing market conditions.

ðŸŸ¢ Implementation & Development Roadmap

Current Features:
	â€¢	Historical covariance-based risk & PnL attribution
	â€¢	Regression-driven hedging integration
	â€¢	Fast, flexible scenario modeling (selected groups or tenors)
	â€¢	Full decomposition of risk and PnL by market dimensions

Future Enhancements (TODOs):
	â€¢	Include futures and derivatives for broader product coverage
	â€¢	Realized portfolio-level PnL tracking
	â€¢	Incorporate carry components (coupon, financing)
	â€¢	Expand scenario builder (e.g., stress/mute countries, tenors)
